Most of the RefinedRP foundation 

MonkeyLib Requires a build of GAS ( or OPENPERMISSIONS ) 
Possibly requires a build of SAM / SCB Chatbox ( overloads functions for secondary usergroup support ) 

I'd only use this if you actually know how to code - this was built for RefinedRP; it's not working out of the box.
